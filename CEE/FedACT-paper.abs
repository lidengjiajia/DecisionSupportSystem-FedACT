Federated learning provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for collaborative credit scoring across financial institutions, yet its distributed architecture is inherently vulnerable to Byzantine attacks where malicious participants submit poisoned model updates to corrupt the global model. Existing Byzantine-resilient aggregation methods either rely on restrictive assumptions about data homogeneity or exhibit limited effectiveness against sophisticated, adaptive attacks. This paper proposes FedACT (Federated Autoencoder-Committee-TLBO), a novel three-stage defense framework specifically designed for heterogeneous federated credit scoring environments. The first stage employs an adaptive autoencoder-based anomaly detector that learns task-specific gradient distributions and computes composite anomaly scores combining reconstruction error with latent space deviation. The second stage introduces a diversity-aware committee voting mechanism that provides consensus-based secondary verification for borderline cases through reputation-weighted member selection. The third stage applies Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) for robust gradient aggregation, iteratively refining the global update through teacher-learner dynamics. We further integrate a Merkle tree-based evidence chain for audit traceability and a reputation-based incentive mechanism for dynamic contribution weighting. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world credit scoring datasets under twelve attack types and four data heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that FedACT achieves detection precision exceeding 95\% and maintains model accuracy within 2\% of attack-free baselines, substantially outperforming seven state-of-the-art defense methods. Our framework provides theoretical insights into Byzantine-resilient federated optimization and offers practical guidance for deploying secure collaborative credit scoring systems in the financial industry.
