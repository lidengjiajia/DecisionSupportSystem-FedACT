Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaborative credit scoring across financial institutions, yet its distributed architecture is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks where malicious participants submit poisoned model updates. Existing defenses assume data homogeneity---an assumption fundamentally violated in cross-institutional credit scoring where banks serve distinct customer populations. This paper proposes FedACT, a three-stage Byzantine-resilient framework: (1) an adaptive autoencoder-based anomaly detector computing dual-metric scores (reconstruction error weighted at 0.7 plus latent deviation at 0.3) with three-zone thresholding (boundaries at $0.7\tau$ and $1.5\tau$), (2) a diversity-maximizing committee voting mechanism for consensus-based verification of uncertain gradients, and (3) Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) for robust gradient aggregation with reputation-based incentives (normal: $r_i + 0.05c_i$; anomalous: $r_i \times 0.7$). We further integrate Merkle tree evidence chains for regulatory compliance. Experiments on UCI Credit Card and Xinwang Bank datasets under twelve attack types and four heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate FedACT achieves $>$95\% detection precision while maintaining accuracy within 2\% of attack-free baselines, substantially outperforming seven state-of-the-art defenses including Krum, Bulyan, and FLTrust.
