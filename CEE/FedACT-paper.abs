Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaborative credit scoring across financial institutions, yet its distributed architecture is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks where participants submit arbitrary model updates. This threat is amplified by data heterogeneity inherent in cross-silo consortia, which invalidates the clustering assumptions underlying existing defenses.

We propose FedACT, a three-stage Byzantine-resilient framework comprising: (1) an autoencoder-based anomaly detector with dual-metric scoring and MAD-based adaptive thresholding that partitions gradients into normal, uncertain, and anomalous zones; (2) a diversity-aware committee voting mechanism that resolves uncertain cases through consensus verification; and (3) TLBO-based robust aggregation coupled with reputation-driven incentives and Merkle-tree evidence chaining for auditability. Experiments on real-world credit datasets under twelve attack types and four heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that FedACT maintains strong detection accuracy and model performance where existing defenses degrade.
