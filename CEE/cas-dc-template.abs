Faced the privacy, security and credible requirements in collaborative credit modelling, and the inherent deficiencies of blockchain and federated learning, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated collaborative credit modeling method (BPFL) through federated learning empowered by Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, as well as the privacy guarantee of CKKS homomorphic encryption technology. Specifically, the decentralized storage and learning architecture of Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and federated learning achieves secure and trustworthy circulation of multi-party credit data. CKKS-based BPFL guarantees compliant modeling of vertical federated logistic regression. Moreover, the deployment of SHAP values-based contributivity calculation contracts enhances the explanation of credit default prediction and simultaneously realizes the effective monitoring of all participants. The convergence analysis and experimental system validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.
