Federated learning enables collaborative credit scoring across financial institutions without sharing raw data, yet remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit poisoned gradients to corrupt the global model. Existing Byzantine-resilient aggregation methods often exhibit limited effectiveness against sophisticated attacks or suffer from high false positive rates under heterogeneous data settings. This paper proposes FedACT (Federated Autoencoder-Committee-TLBO), a novel defense framework that integrates three complementary mechanisms: (1) an adaptive autoencoder-based gradient anomaly detector that learns the distribution of benign gradients and identifies anomalies through reconstruction error; (2) a diversity-aware committee voting mechanism that provides secondary verification for uncertain cases; and (3) a Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) aggregation strategy that robustly combines trusted gradients. Additionally, we incorporate a Merkle tree-based evidence chain for audit traceability and a reputation-based incentive mechanism for dynamic weight adjustment. Extensive experiments on two credit scoring datasets under 12 attack types and 4 heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that FedACT achieves superior defense performance with detection precision exceeding 95\%, significantly outperforming 7 state-of-the-art defense methods.
